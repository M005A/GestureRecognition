# 🖐️ Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition  

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using machine learning and computer vision, enabling interactive feedback through live webcam input. The system is designed for efficient real-time processing and classification, displaying gesture results and accuracy on-screen.  

## 🚀 Features  

- **Custom Gesture Recognition Model**: Trained using TensorFlow and Keras for accurate real-time classification.  
- **Live Webcam Input**: Captures and processes gestures dynamically.  
- **Optimized for Performance**: Uses CUDA acceleration for faster inference on compatible GPUs.  
- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Preprocessed and labeled image datasets for effective training and validation.  
- **Interactive Feedback**: Displays detected gestures along with confidence levels.

## 📊 Model Training  

The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras on a labeled dataset of hand gestures. CUDA acceleration was used to optimize the training speed. The training workflow includes:  

1. **Data Collection**: Capturing and preprocessing hand gesture images.  
2. **Model Training**: Using CNN-based architecture to classify gestures.  
3. **Evaluation**: Testing accuracy and optimizing performance.  

## 🎥 Live Gesture Recognition  

The system captures live webcam input, classifies gestures in real-time, and displays the results with accuracy metrics.
